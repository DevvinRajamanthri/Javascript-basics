<h1>For loops<h1>
<h2>What is a for loop</h2>
<p>A for loop is a block of code that runs the same code repeditly. Now i will show you how to write one.</p>
 <h2>how to write a for loop </h2>
 <code>for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++){<br>
  console.log(i)<br>
 } </code>
 <br>
 <h2>Defining the variable in the start of the loop</h2>
<br><p>To make a for loop, you need to write for. Then write a pair of paranthisis then inside the paranthisis you need to write let i = 0.
 <br>i is the variable at what index the loop starts at.
 <br>You dont need to write i as your main variable.  
 <br> You can actually change i to any word or letter you want.
 <br> Same goes with the zero. You dont have to use that as your starting index value.
 <br> Then add a semicolon to start a new section.

 
 <br>

 <h2>Writing the condition </h2>
 <br>Now at the next section, you are going to write the condition. I wrote i is less than five so then every eteration if i is less than five the loop will run. Otherwise the loop will stop.
 <h2>Writing the  increment</h2>
 <br>Then we will write the increment which  determinds the next value of the variable i.

 <br>
 <h2>Writing what will happen in each iteration</h2>
 <br> Finally we are going to write a pair of curly brackets.<br>
  Inside the curly brackets we are going to write whats going to happen in each iteration.
