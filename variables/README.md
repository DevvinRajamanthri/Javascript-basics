<h1>Variables</h1>
<h2>What is a variable</h2>
<p>A variable is like a storage container but it holds data.</p>
<h2>Declaring a variable</h2>
<p>Declaring means starting a variable.You can delare a variable by using let.</p>
<p>Let a = "hello";</p>
<p>When you use the let command it turns the letter or word to the right of it into a variable.For example,
on the right there is a string with the value hello. The value hello is then transferd to a the variable.</p>
<h2>Addition</h2>
<p>Addition adds two intigers together.</p>
<p>For example lets say a = 1 and b = 2 if you write a statement that has  console.log(a + b) it will display 3.</p>
<h2>Subtraction</h2>
<p>Subtraction removes one intiger from another.</p>
<p>Lets say a = 1 and b = 1 console.log(a - b) will equal 0.</p>
<h2>Multiplication</h2>
<p>If a = 3 and b = 9 the console.log(a x b) will equal 9.</p>
<h>Concatnation</h2>
<p>concatination adds two strings together so if a = "hello" and b = "world" the final result will be "helloworld"</p>
<p>addition adds two intigers together so if a = 3 and b = 3 the final result will be 6</p>
