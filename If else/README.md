<p>In this video we are learning about the if condition and else condition
<br>
If conditions are used to check if a condition is true or false and to make decisions
<br>
I have briefly talked about this before
<br>


The  if command is executed if a specified condition is true
<br>
If conditions  start with the keyword if, followed by a pair of parentheses. Inside the parentheses, write the condition.
<br>


When the program is run it will Console log “a and b are the same”
<br>
Now assume that a does not equal b what will we do then. We will write and else condition like this
<code>
Let a = 2;
<br>
Let b = 1;
<br>
 if(a==b){<br>
    console.log(a and b are the same);<br>
 }else{ <br>
    console.log(a is not equal to b)<br>
}
</code><br>
The else condition runs when the if condition is false:<br>
Now let's take a look at the second example. We want to find out if a number is even or odd. Let’s try finding it out.<br>
 <code><br>
Let a = 2;<br>
if(a%2 == 0){<br>
    console.log(“a is even”);<br>
}else{  <br>
console.log(“a is odd”)<br>
</code>
}
