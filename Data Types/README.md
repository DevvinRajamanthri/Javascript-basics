<h1>What  Are Data Types</h1>
<h2>A data type is something like a String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null and Array</h2>
<h3>Strings</h3>
<p>A string is like a container for characters like "coding with dev"</p>
<br>   
<p>there are characters inside the string</p>
<br>
<p>characters are "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"</p>
<p>lets see how to define a string</p>
<code>
let s = "char1"
</code>
<p>That was what defining a string looks like<p>
<code>let a = "char";<br>
let b = "char2";<br>
let c = a + b;<br>
console.log(c);

console.log(typeof a);</code>
<br>
<p>the result will say that c is a string because it has characters in it</p>

<h3>Numbers</h3>
<p>Numbers is also data type</p>
<p>lets assign a number to variable</p>
<br>
<code>
let a = 1;
</code>
<p>Thats a number looks like when its assigned to a varible </p>
<code>
let a = 1;<br>
let b = 1;<br>
let c = a + b;<br>
console.log(c);


console.log(typeof a);</code>
<br><p>The result will say that c is a number</p>
<br>
      <h3>boolean</h3>
<p>
a boolean checks if the value is true or false</p>
<br>
<p>a boolean can be used with comparison operators</p>
<br>
<code>
let a = 1;<br>
let b = 1;<br>
let c = a == b;

console.log(typeof c)<br>

</code>

<p>the result will say that c is a boolean</p>

<h3>Undefined</h3>
<p>A variable that has not been assigned a value</p>
<br>

<br>
<code>let c =  ;<br>
<br>  
console.log(typeof c);
</code>
<br>
<p>the result will say that c is undefined</p>


<h3>Null</h3>
<p>its a assigned value that means nothing</p>
<br>
<code>let c = null ;<br>  
console.log(typeof c);
</code>
<br>
<p>the result will say that c is a null</p>


<h3>Array</h3>
<p>Array is a type of object</p>
<br>
<p>Lets see what it looks like</p>
<br><code>let testarray = [test];<br><br></code>
<code>let a = [array1];<br>
let b = [array2];<br>
let c = a + b;<br>  
console.log(typeof c);
</code>
<br>
<p>the result will say that c is a  array</p>
