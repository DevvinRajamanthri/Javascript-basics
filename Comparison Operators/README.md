<h1>Comparison Operators</h1>
<h2>Equal to ==</h2>
    <p>This comparison operator checks if the variable/string on the left is equal to the variable/string on the right </p>
<h2>Not equal to !=</h2>
<p>This comparison operator checks if the variable/string on the left is not equal to the variable/string on the right</p>
<h2>Greater than > </h2>
<p>This comparison operator checks if the variable/string on the left is greater than the variable/string on the right</p>
<h2>Less than < </h2>
    <p>This comparison operator checks if the variable/string on the left is less than the variable/string on the right</p>
<h2>Greater than or equal to >=</h2>
    <p>This comparison operator checks if the variable/string on the left is greater than or equal to the variable/string on the right</p>
<h2>Less than or equal to <= </h2>
    <p>This comparison operator checks if the variable/string on the left is less than or equal to the variable/string on the right</p> 
<h1>Example</h1>
<h3>Example1</h3>

<code>
let i = 3;<br>
let d = 3;<br>

if(i==d){
    <br>
    console.log("i is equal to d")<br>
}
</code>  
if this statement is true then it will say i is equal than b
<h3>Example2</h3>
<code>
let i = 3;<br>
let d = 3;<br>


if(i!=d){<br>
    console.log("i is not equal to than d")<br>

}
</code> 
if this statement is true then it will  say i is not equal to than b 

<h3>Example3</h3>
<code>let i = 3;<br>
let d = 3;<br>

if(i>d){<br>
    console.log("i is greater than d")<br>
} 
</code>

if this statement is true then it will  say console.log i is greater than d 

<h3>Example4</h3>
<code>
let i = 3;><br>
let d = 3;<br>
if(i<'d){<br>
    console.log("i is less than d")<br>
} 
</code>
 
if this statement is true then it will say i is less than to than d 

<h3>Example5</h3>
<code>let d = 3;<br>

if(i>=d){<br>
    console.log("i is greater or equal to  d")<br>
}
</code> 
<br>
if this statement is true then it will say i is greater or equal to  d

                                     
<h3>Example6</h3>
<code>let i = 3;<br>
let d = 3;<br>
if(i<=d){<br>
    console.log("i is  less than or equal to d")<br>
}<br>
</code>  
if this statement is true then it will say i is less than or equal to  d
